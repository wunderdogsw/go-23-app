[Develop a simple Points of Interest app](https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/location-based-three/)

A "Hello World" app which sets user location to north. It is using fake GPS. It draws a rectangular in front of the user and allows to move from left to right with a mouse clicks and movements.

## How to run
In arjs-experiment folder
- run npm i (maybe you would need to install xcode-select at first)
- run npm buid
- open index.htm in browser (I used live-server for this)
